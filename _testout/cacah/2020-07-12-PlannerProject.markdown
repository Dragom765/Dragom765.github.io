This was a fairly simple project, but one I had a formal review process for that taught me a lot early on.

With a simple Full-Stack design using a Node.js server, HTML/JavaScript/CSS web page, and a MySQL server,
I designed and created a very basic application that let a user list out their weekly schedule on a web page
after logging in.

I revisited this project again years later when I was asked to come up with the first curriculum for
Software Saturdays, and used it to create a simplified version for interested students on campus to learn
the Full Stack development concept.
