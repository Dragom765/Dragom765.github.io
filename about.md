  This page is to document some of my work and capabilities.
  If you'd like to contact me, please use my email in the footer.

  As far as what's generally linked here, you'll find a lot of Node.js in my
  personal and school club projects, from my Full Stack development roots.
  I'm currently keen on future projects that lean into the world of Data Science
  & Analytics, so you may see new additions in that area in the next few years.
  
  In addition, my college courses were generally focused in C/C++, Java,
  and Python. They covered anything from algorithms, data structures, and OOP,
  to microcontroller coding, AI, and general Software Engineering practices.<br>There are
  one or two school projects (like Facial Morphing, or my simple trained Keras network
  to find face points) that I may recreate and host to show off, but for now I belive
  just my Senior Design project is linked -- though that does use some facial
  recognition, which is fun and surprisingly straightforward.
  
  Lastly, I'm currently a Software Engineer with a company called Flooid, in a Java
  Application Development role, though that's proprietary work and won't be
  included here.
