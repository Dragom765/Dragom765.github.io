  This page is to document some of my work and capabilities.
  If you'd like to contact me about any of my work, use my email at the
  bottom of this page.

  As far as what's generally linked here, you'll find a lot of Node.js in my
  personal projects and school clubs. I'm currently keen on future projects that
  lean into the world of Data Science & Analytics, so you may see new additions
  in that area in the next few years.
  I'm currently a Software Engineer with Flooid in a Java Application Development
  role, though that's proprietary work and won't be included here.
  
  In addition, my college courses were generally focused in C/C++, Java,
  and Python. They covered anything from algorithms, data structures, and OOP,
  to microcontroller coding, AI, and general Software Engineering practices.

  I've also done a few minor things with facial recognition, and plan on doing more.
