I"<p>This repository is for a project I’m doing personally to learn Heroku.</p>

<p>Picking up Redis along the way, I’ll be adding it as a layer between the web page
and the Posgresql instance for traffic managing practice, and learning Redis in
general.</p>

<p>I’ll be touching on this more later, but life picked up after I started getting the
Posgresql instance connected to Nodejs, and all hosting properly on a basic
Heroku setup.</p>
