Purdue IEEE ROV was a campus club that built an underwater drone from scratch each year
to compete in the International MATE competition each summer.
We used a Python codebase on a Raspberry Pi for the control software, connecting to a
Nodejs Electron application hosted on a laptop for the Pilot's readout and driver screens.

I was with them for 3 years, and was the Surface Group Head and a Software Co-Lead in my
2nd and 3rd years respectively. I became heavily familiar with Git and GitHub, and helped
push our goal to not only be a successful team during competition, but to make our software
more modular, friendlier to testing, and easier to learn for new members.

During my time there, I was able to push our modularity forward with pushing a modular React
design during my year as Surface Group Head, and aiding with the conversion of our control
software to a ROS implementation in my final year as Software Co-Lead.
