This project was a simple implementation of a facial recognition library I've used in classes twice before.

It's been left fairly simple somewhat intentionally -- as an intro to my younger cousin for this Python library,
I didn't want to complicate the learning curve. Otherwise you'd see more Object Oriented design.

You can find a more involved usage of this library in my work for my Senior Design project.

Find more on the `face_recognition` project page: [face_recognition](https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/)

I've included a nice little graphic from their page, that shows the results of its face-boxing and identification
abilities fairly well.
