This repository is for a project I'm doing personally to learn Heroku.

Picking up Redis along the way, I'll be adding it as a layer between the web page
and the Posgresql instance for traffic managing practice, and learning Redis in
general.

I'll be touching on this more later, but life picked up after I started getting the
Posgresql instance connected to Nodejs, and all hosting properly on a basic
Heroku setup, so it still has template data loaded in. I'll be adding my own data in
the end product, but that *definitely* will not be public; I'll instruct how to
load your own.
